In this zip is my answer to the CWT case study. i attempted question 1,2,3 and 4 using pandas.

the script should just run as is. if not it will need pandas and numpy installed. once ran it will create the csv's q1,
q2,q3 and q4 these being what I believe is the answer to the questions. the number of rows requested in each question is 
in the terminal.

Thank you for considering me.
